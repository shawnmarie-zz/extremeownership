# Preface

* We learned that leadership requires belief in the mission and unyeilding perserverance to achieve victory, particularly
when doubters question whether victory is even possible.

* Relax, Look, Make a Call (p.4)

* Laws of Combat
  * Cover and Move
  * Simple
  * Prioritize and Execute - highest priority first
  * Decentralized Command
  
* Without a team, a group of individuals working to accomplish a mission, there can be no leadership.

* The only meaningful measure for a leader is if the team succeds or fails.

* There are only 2 characterizations of leaders that matter:
  * Effective
  * Ineffective
  * That is all

* Every leader and team will fail at some point
  * Nobody is infallible
  * Need to have the humility to admin mistakes & develop a plan to overcome then is essential to success

* The best leaders focus on the mission & how best to accomplish it.

* Extreme Ownership
  * Leaders must own everything else in their world. There is no one else to blame.
