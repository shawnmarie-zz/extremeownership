# Preface

* We learned that leadership requires belief in the mission and unyeilding perserverance to achieve victory, particularly
when doubters question whether victory is even possible.

* Relax, Look, Make a Call (p.4)

* Laws of Combat
  * Cover and Move
  * Simple
  * Prioritize and Execute - highest priority first
  * Decentralized Command
  
* Without a team, a group of individuals working to accomplish a mission, there can be no leadership.

* The only meaningful measure for a leader is if the team succeds or fails.

* There are only 2 characterizations of leaders that matter:
  * Effective
  * Ineffective
  * That is all

* Every leader and team will fail at some point
  * Nobody is infallible
  * Need to have the humility to admin mistakes & develop a plan to overcome then is essential to success

* The best leaders focus on the mission & how best to accomplish it.

* Extreme Ownership
  * Leaders must own everything else in their world. There is no one else to blame.

# Chapter 1, "Extreme Ownership"

* His realization that what happened with the blue-on-blue was his fault.

  > I had to take complete ownership of what went wrong. 
  > That is what a leader does - even if it means getting fired.

* On any team, in any organization, all responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader.*The leader must own everything in his or her world.* There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failure, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.
  * Interesting when speaking of success he speaks to blame in the same breath.

* The best leader don't just take *responsibility* for their job. They take *Extreme Ownership* of everything that impacts their mission.

* Leaders must first look in the mirror at themselves. The leader bears full responsibility for explaining the strategic mission,  devloping the tactics, and securing the training and resources to enable th team to properly and successfully execute.

* The leader must train and mentor the underperformer. If the underperformers cannot improve, the leader ust make the tough call to terminate them and hire others who can get the job done. It is all on the leader.

* As individuals we often
  * Attribute the success of others to luck or circumstances.
  * Make excuses for our own failures and the failures of our team.
  * Blame our own poor performance on bad luck or
    * Circumstances beyond our control or
    * Poorly performing subordinates
    * Anyone but ourselves.
